# 3D-Wireframe-Renderer

This project is a basic 3D wireframe renderer implemented using SDL. 

It demonstrates the rotation of a 3D cube in real-time by projecting 3D points onto a 2D plane and rendering the edges as lines. The renderer uses basic matrix transformations to achieve rotation around the X, Y, and Z axes.
